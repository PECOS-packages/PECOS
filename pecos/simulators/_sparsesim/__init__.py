SparseStabSim
=============

This is a stabilizer simulation that takes advantage of the structure of LDPC codes; more precisely, it utilizes the 
row and column-wise sparseness of stabilizer tableau.

12/28/2014  CRA     File created.

05/23/2017  CRA     The stabilizer simulation was separated from the entire QECC tool chain to allow others to more 
                    easily utilize the simulator on its own. The __init__ file has been reduced and modified for this
                    purpose.
