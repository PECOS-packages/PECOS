Monte Carlo Script
==================

In this appendix, I present how PECOS can be used to create a script to runs a Monte Carlo simulation to determine
logical error-rates versus physical error-rates for a fixed distance of a medial surface-code patch. The break-even
point where the physical error-rate equals the logical error-rate is known as the `pseudo-threshold`. The `threshold` is
the value the pseudo-threshold converges to as the distance of the code approaches infinity.

We begin by creating a Python script ``error_rates.py`` and importing NumPy and PECOS:

.. code-block:: python

   import numpy as np
   import pecos as pc

For this example, we will evaluate the identity gate of ``SurfaceMedial4444`` and start in the ideal logical zero-state:

.. code-block:: python

   surface = pc.qeccs.SurfaceMedial4444(distance=3)
   logic = pc.circuits.LogicalCircuit(layout=surface.layout)
   logic.append(surface.gate('ideal init |0>'))
   logic.append(surface.gate('I', num_syn_extract=1))
   circ_runner = pc.circuit_runners.Standard(seed=0)
   logical_ops = surface.instruction('instr_syn_extract').final_logical_ops[0]

Here we also initialize the ``circuit_runner`` we will use and create the variable ``logical_ops``, which stores the
logical operations of the QECC. This can be used to determine the logical error-rate since we can track whether errors
flip the signs of the logical operators.

Now we choose the depolarizing channel as our noise model (see :ref:`error-gens`) and the MWPM decoder (see
:ref:`decoders`) to interpret syndromes and determine recovery operations:

.. code-block:: python

   depolar = pc.error_gens.DepolarGen(model_level='code_capacity')
   decode = pc.decoders.MWPM2D(surface).decode


We next create the function  ``determine_fails`` to decide if logical error occurs by examining whether, after applying
a recovery operation to the state, errors have flipped logical :math:`Z`. Note, since we are just protecting a logical
zero-state we are only concerned with errors that flip the sign of the logical :math:`Z` operator. :math:`Z` errors do
not affect the state.

The ``determine_fails`` function is:
 
.. code-block:: python

   def determine_fails(meas, decoder, circ_runner, state, logical_ops, fails):
       if meas:
           recovery = decoder(meas)
           circ_runner.run(state, recovery)
       sign = state.logical_sign(logical_ops['Z'], logical_ops['X'])
       fails += sign    
       return fails

We are now almost ready to define the Monte Carlo loop. First, however, we set ``runs`` to represent the number of
evaluations we will make per physical error-rate. Next, we add the variable ``ps``, which is set to an array of  10
linearly space points between 0.1 and 0.3 to serve as the physical error-rates that we will evaluate. This array is
created by NumPy's ``linspace`` function. Finally, we include the variable ``plog``, which stores the logical
error-rates we find corresponding to the physical error-rates in ``ps``. All of this is done in the following lines:

.. code-block:: python
   
   runs = 10000
   ps = np.linspace(0.1, 0.4, 10)
   plog = []

We now create the Monte Carlo loop, which prepares a fresh initial state, applies depolarizing noise with a probability chosen by looping over ``ps``, and counts the number of failures (logical flips) to determine the logical error-rate, which is stored in ``plog``:

.. code-block:: python

   for p in ps:
       fails = 0
       for i in range(runs):
           state = pc.simulators.SparseSim(surface.num_qudits)
           meas, _ = circ_runner.run(state, logic, error_gen=depolar, error_params={'p': p})
           fails = determine_fails(meas, decoder, circ_runner, state, logical_ops, fails)
       plog.append(fails / runs)
   print('ps=', list(ps))
   print('plog=', plog)

When this script is ran, an example output is:

.. code-block:: python

   ps= [0.1, 0.13333333333333336, 0.16666666666666669, 0.2, 0.23333333333333336, 0.2666666666666667,
   0.30000000000000004, 0.33333333333333337, 0.3666666666666667, 0.4]
   plog= [0.0588, 0.102, 0.1497, 0.1835, 0.2241, 0.2702, 0.3052, 0.3485, 0.3783, 0.4017]


One can then use plotting packages such as Matplotlib to produce plots as appropriate for the data. PECOS provides a
tool for quickly plotting and evaluating logical vs physical error-rates:

.. code-block:: python

   from pecos.tools import plot_pseudo
   plot_pseudo(deg=2,plist=ps,plog=plog)

Running this tool results in the plot:


.. image:: ../images/nonmedial_pseudo_threshold.png
   :align: center
   :width: 400px

The script described in this appendix can be used as a basis for developing other Monte Carlo simulation scripts for
evaluating pseudo-thresholds or thresholds.
